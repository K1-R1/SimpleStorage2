# SimpleStorage2

## A reconstruction of SimpleStoarge1, utilising the brownie framework

A basic contract to store values and associate them with an alias.
Interaction with the contract once deployed:
- Store value
- Retreive stored values
- Store mapping of alias to value

The contract is deployed to the rinkeby test network.

Made with brownie.
